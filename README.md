New Years resolution repository to get started early in 2021 for 2022. I would like to create a project to commit to it at least once a week. This repository is for the absolute beginner programmer. We will set up a basic work environment on a Mac to get you up and running quickly.

2022 is here. Let's get started. (:youtube: LINK HERE [placeholder])... I will be dropping a YouTube link that will go over the basics of what it is I am trying to accomplish this year. 
    At the end of 2021, I needed to clean up my :computer:. I made a terrible mistake and did a factory reboot. I don't want you to make the same mistakes and ruin your :computer: or have to spend several :dollar: to recover a disk. That is where we will start.
